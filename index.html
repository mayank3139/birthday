                <h3>Happy birthday my love(future wife). I Don't believe in love at first side but after seeing you everything changes. 
                    Now a day I don't know what is happening to me i can't sleep properly. All day just waiting for your reply and specially waiting for night so i can do video call with you. yeah this is first time i am felling this. Yeah I know it only few days before we meet eachother on Ome TV but after seeing you my heart is becoming yours every second i think about you. When you reply late i just wait for your reply every second act like an hours. I know i am boring but adjust little bit.
                    At last just i want to say you can find 1000 boys better than me but i can't find girl better than you. So, will you become mom of my future kids.
